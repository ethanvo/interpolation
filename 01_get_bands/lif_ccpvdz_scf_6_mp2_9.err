/burg/berkelbach/users/eav2136/builds/pyscf/projected-cvs/pyscf/pyscf/pbc/tools/lattice.py:137: UserWarning: Use ase.build.bulk() instead
  ase_atom = bulk('LiF', 'rocksalt', a=4.0351*A2B)
WARNING!
  Very diffused basis functions are found in the basis set. They may lead to severe
  linear dependence and numerical instability.  You can set  cell.exp_to_discard=0.1
  to remove the diffused Gaussians whose exponents are less than 0.1.
